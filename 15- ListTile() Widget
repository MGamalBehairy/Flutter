ListTile() Widget  is ready Widget that u can use , to ease the work for u , instead to build everything from scratch, ListTile help u to do that

ListTile contains   "leading" (first thing), "title"(second thing), "sub-title"     like Scaffold contains "app Bar, "body", "floating Action Button"


ListTile(
  leading:       // is the first thing appear
)

            -------------  Card() Widget  ------------

- ListTile()  most of times used with Card() Widget ,   to add shape and background  for ListTile()

Card(
  child: ListTile(
    leading: Icon(
      Icongs.location_pin,
      color: Color(0xFFABCDEFGH),
    )
    title: Text('NearBY_U'),
  )
)




conclusion:   ListTile()   is  more easier to use than Container then use Row() widget , then use Spacer() or Padding()

cuz ListTile()   have Circular Shape Border    and   margin     and  Row        by-default !!,   just need to use Card()  and ListTile()
