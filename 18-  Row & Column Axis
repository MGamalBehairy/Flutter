to know wich one is the main or cross axis, 

look how it will order, for example Row()  will order the widgets in the x-axis,  so x-axis is the "main"  and y-axis is the cross


and Column()   order widgets in the y-axis,    so the y-axis  will be the main-axis ....




to give equal spaces between widgets: 
Row(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly,        // spaceEvenly   will give Equal spaces
