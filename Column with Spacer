when use Column widget with Spacer widget, u may face an Exception,   cuz  Spacer  want to take as much as it could from the screen,  but to do this , u need to add "height" to the Column Widget , to make it bounded
or u can use SizedBox() ,      


so again , u need to know how Spacer() Work,  and if u didn't set the boundaries, u get an error,    if   the Column was bounded not free
