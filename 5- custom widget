how to create custom widget   like   Text(),  Center(), AppBar(),  ....
becase we don't need to write all code in the runApp() widget


Types of Widget:-

1- StatelessWidget                                                                  2- stateful widget

StatelessWidget =>> it's a new widget and take name for this widget
                    - it's a Class


try to type stateless and then choose it from choices

Class HelloWorldApp extends StatelessWidget{
  HelloWorldApp();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container();
  }
}
