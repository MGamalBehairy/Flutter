when use Column widget with Spacer widget, u may face an Exception,   cuz  Spacer  want to take as much as it could from the screen,  but to do this , u need to add "height" to the Column Widget , to make it bounded
or u can use SizedBox(height: 100,) ,      


-------------------------- so if the "Column()" has not determine "height" (unbounded) ,  and try to use Spacer(),  then u will get an  Exception -----------

u need to know how Spacer() Work,  and if u didn't set the boundaries, u get an error,    if   the Column was bounded not free 

---------- so how Column is not Bounded (unknow height) ? =>>  when it depends on the chidren of the Column --------------
